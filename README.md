# Banana talk
 Translator made with vanillaJS which translates simple text into minion language!

# Description
Are you a fan of minions? Did you know that the gibberish they say is an actual language. This translator made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, is used to convert english into minion language. I hope to add a minion voice API in few days after improving my skills.

# How does it work
User have to put their text at the given box and they will get the translated text in the box.
